**Country Medal Prediction Model**
This project uses machine learning to predict the number of medals a country will win in future international competitions (e.g., Olympics) based on historical data and key statistics. The model is built using a linear regression algorithm and evaluated for accuracy using mean absolute error. The project also includes data preprocessing, feature selection, and error analysis by team.

Project Overview
The model predicts medal counts for countries based on past performance, including factors like the number of athletes and previous medal counts. The dataset is split into training and testing sets, with training data from years before 2012 and test data from 2012 onward. The predictions are evaluated using mean absolute error, and the errors are analyzed by team to provide insights into the model's performance.

Features
Data Preprocessing: The data is cleaned by removing rows with missing values and filtered to include relevant features such as athletes, prev_medals, medals, year, and team.
Modeling: A linear regression model is used to predict the number of medals, with features like athletes and prev_medals as predictors.
Evaluation: The model’s performance is evaluated using mean absolute error (MAE) and error analysis by team.
Visualization: The project includes visualizations of medal distributions and error ratios for each team.
Requirements

Installation
To install the necessary dependencies, run:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Ensure that the dataset teams.csv is available in the working directory.
Run the script to preprocess the data, train the model, and make predictions.

Results
The model predicts the number of medals countries are likely to win based on historical trends. The error analysis provides insights into how well the model performs for each country, helping identify potential areas for improvement.

Future Work
Experiment with more advanced machine learning models (e.g., decision trees, random forests) to improve prediction accuracy.
Incorporate additional features, such as GDP, population, and investment in sports, to enhance the model’s predictions.
